# Jekyll Template with HTML 5 Boilerplate and "320 and up"

## Boilerplate
I pull boilerplate directly from the [Github repository](https://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate "Github repository of HTML5 Boilerplate") from the branch stripped, so all the comments and links and stuff are left out. If you need comments, you should check out a copy of the master branch. Ignore the mobile branch: 920 and up takes care of that.

## 320 and up
I have to download "320 and up" directly from the homepage, as there appears to be no repository available for the public. The version included in the initial release of this is v0.9. If there is a repository available and I'm just to stupid to find it, please tell me.

You can find more about "320 and up" [here](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/ "320 and up").
